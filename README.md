SchedCaltrain
=============

### Usage
1. Run `make`.
2. Open `caltrain.json` in your editor.

### Example Integration
`query.js` is provided in the `example` directory for integration reference. Try it out by entering the directory and running `node query [train number] [station]`. Give the script a read to see how it parses (very simply) the train times using Javascript's native `Date` "class".
